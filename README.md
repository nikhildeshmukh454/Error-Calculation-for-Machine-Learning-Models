Error Calculation for Machine Learning Models
This C++ class Evaluation provides methods to calculate key performance metrics for evaluating machine learning models:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Computes the average of the absolute differences between actual and predicted values.
MSE (Mean Squared Error): Computes the average of the squares of the differences between actual and predicted values.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Computes the square root of the average of the squares of the differences between actual and predicted values.
R-squared (RÂ²): Computes the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Adjusted R-squared: Adjusts the R-squared value based on the number of predictors and the number of observations.
